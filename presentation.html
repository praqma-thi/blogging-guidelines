# Ground rules

Before you even start writing, decide on your:

 * subject
 * target audience
 * goal
 * tone


This will help you write a consistent and enjoyable post.

---

## Ground rules - Subject .img-i[![microscope](img/microscope.png)]
 
### What are you writing about?

What toolstack, problem, solution, methodology, etc. is the text about?

_Tips:_

* List some key points you want to make beforehand
* Link to external resources instead of going on tangents

---

## Ground rules - Target audiance .img-i[![audience](img/audience.png)]
 
### Who are you writing for?

Are they technical experts, fresh rookies or oblivious managers?

_Tips:_

 * Write a small bio of your hypothetical reader
 * Look for assumptions of pre-existing knowledge in your post

---

## Ground rules - Goal .img-i[![goal](img/goal.png)]
 
### What do you want to achieve?

Do you want to inspire, spark discussion, or document a deviously clever hack?

_Tips:_

 * Make suggestions
 * Link to more resources
 * Ask open questions
 * Provide copy-paste examples

---

 ## Ground rules - Tone .img-i[![tone](img/tone.png)]
  
 ### How do you want to come across?
 
Are you narrating an idelic scene, critically analyzing a toolstack, or humorously retelling a story from the trenches?

 _Tips:_
  * Try out different tones of writing
  * Avoid negative comments when writing a feel-good post
  * Insert your personal thoughts and opinions

---

# Fairy dust

To spice up your language and make it a more enjoyable read, add: 

 * a dash of Aristotle
 * a pinch of Sinek
 * a sprinkling of Orwell
 * a bucket of your wonderful self

---

## Fairy dust - Aristotle .img-i[![aristotle](img/aristotle.png)]

_A convincing argument contains character, emotion and logic. Ethos, pathos and logos._

_Tips:_
 
 * Show empathy and good intent to gain credibility
 * Describe and exemplify to elicit emotion
 * Back up your points and conclusions, link to data

---

## Fairy dust - Sinek .img-i[![sinek](img/sinek.png)]

_People don't buy_ what _you do, they buy_ why _you do it

.center[<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5Tw0PGcyN0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]

_Tips:_
 
 * Bring up why you implemented or documented your subject in the first place

---

 ## Fairy dust - Orwell .img-i[![quill](img/quill.png)]
 
* _Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech that you often see in print._<br />
* _Never use a long word where a short one will do._<br />
* _If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out._<br />
* _Never use the passive where you can use the active._<br />
* _Never use a foreign phrase, or jargon if you have an everyday equivalent._<br />
* _Break any of these rules sooner than writing anything outright barbarous._<br />

_Tips:_

 * They're more what you'd call... guidelines, than actual rules.

---

 ## Surprise fairy dust! .img-i[![me](img/thi.png)]

 Cull uncertain words like _seems_, _appears_, _might_, _could_, etc.


 It could perhaps appear to be seemingly unnecessary to sometimes have maybe just a bit too many of them.

---

 ## Fairy dust - You .img-i[![selfie](img/selfie.png)]

 Be yourself, don't drown your style in that of others

 _Tips:_

 * Don't worry about _making_ your own style, it's something that _happens_

---

# Tech blog checklist

`-[]` Do you have an enticing opening? (Title/Subtitle/Kicker) <br />
`-[]` Does your title stand on its own? (To the point, not cryptic) <br />
`-[]` Do you have a concluding wrap-up? (Final summary, point back to the kicker) <br />
`-[]` Can people act upon your post? (Link to further resources, discussions, etc.) <br />
`-[]` Is there a sprinkle of colour in your language? (Similes, metaphors, etc.) <br />
`-[]` Do you have a witty tweetable wrap-up in there? (Just for fun) <br />
